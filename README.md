# Consolidated Projection
## Marketing Ads Spend Aggregator & Projection API

---

## Overview

This is a Python-based Flask API designed to automate the retrieval, aggregation, and projection of advertising spend data from **Meta Ads (Facebook/Instagram)** and **Google Ads**.

I built this tool to streamline reporting workflows, provide near real-time budget pacing insights, and enable more data-driven decision-making.

There are 2 endpoints: 
- "/get-projection": returns a simple Json object with total spend, current budget and e a projection for the current month. 
- "/get-full-report": returns a full text report, detailing spend for each account and campaign.

A extended implementation, integrating with Monday.com API and Slack API can be seen in [this repository](https://github.com/jgdemattos/raiox).

## The Challenge: Manual Reporting & Delayed Insights

Marketing teams often manage campaigns across multiple platforms like Meta Ads and Google Ads. Tracking consolidated spend and projecting month-end totals typically involves:

1.  Manually logging into each platform.
2.  Exporting spend data for specific date ranges.
3.  Combining data in spreadsheets.
4.  Manually calculating current pace and projecting future spend.

This process is **time-consuming, prone to errors, and delays access to crucial budget pacing information**, potentially leading to under- or over-spending.

---

## The Solution: An Automated Reporting API

This Flask application provides a centralized solution by:

1.  **Connecting directly** to the Meta Ads and Google Ads APIs using official SDKs/libraries.
2.  **Fetching account and campaign-level spend data** programmatically.
3.  **Aggregating total spend** across both platforms for a given client/account structure.
4.  **Calculating a simple month-end spend projection** based on current daily averages.
5.  **Exposing this data** through two clear API endpoints.

## Key Features & Endpoints

This application offers two primary functionalities accessible via API endpoints:

1.  **`/get-projection`**:
    * **Method:** `GET`
    * **Description:** Returns a concise JSON object containing:
        * `account_cost`: The aggregated total spend across Meta and Google Ads for the current month-to-date.
        * `account_budget`: The pre-defined total budget for the month (can be configured).
        * `total_spend_projected`: A calculated projection of the total spend by the end of the current month based on the average daily spend so far.
    * **Use Case:** Quick budget health checks, dashboard integrations, automated alerts.
    * **Example Response:**
        ```json
        {
          "account_cost": 15234.56,
          "account_budget": 30000.00,
          "total_spend_projected": 31487.90
        }
        ```

2.  **`/get-full-report`**:
    * **Method:** `GET`
    * **Description:** Returns a detailed text-based report outlining:
        * Spend breakdown per platform (Meta Ads, Google Ads).
        * Spend details for individual accounts and potentially campaigns within each platform (depending on implementation granularity).
    * **Use Case:** Deeper dive analysis, identifying high/low spending campaigns, generating detailed summaries for stakeholders.
    * **Example Response (Conceptual):**
